This will reconcile the OFFC emails list
Updated 10/23/18 - updated XL macros
Updated 1/31/19 - use JotForm, changed Evite format to avoid XL macros

There are 3 input files:

1) OFFC Emails.csv - list of club last name, first name, email, alt emails
2) OFFC Forum Emails.csv - list of OFFC Forum names & emails
3) OFFC Evite Emails.csv - list of OFFC Evite contacts names & emails

The program will attempt to open these or prompt if they can't be found.

First two are CSV files with the first line skipped as a header.
The first column should be the friendly name followed by email column(s)
Do not leave any extra commas except the OFFC Emails.csv can have an 
extra comma for the alternate email.  Do not leave any blank or other
lines at the end.

The Evite doesn't have a header, and names & emails alternate lines
